<p>
    You can also set array of objects as items input
</p>

<ng-select [items]="people"
           bindLabel="company"
           bindValue="id"
           [(ngModel)]="selectedPersonId">
</ng-select>

<hr>
<p>
    While array of objects is the most common items source, you may want to set simple array of strings, numbers,
    booleans
</p>

<ng-select [items]="simpleItems"
           [(ngModel)]="selectedSimpleItem">
</ng-select>
